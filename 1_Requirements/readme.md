Research – Costing and Aging
Costing
* Standard Calculator - 3$ - 5$
* Digital Calculator - 	5$ - 7$
* Scientific Calculator - 10$ - 15$
Aging
* Past - Analog and user had to interact more and performed only some simple operations. 	
* Present - Digital and scientific which performs complex operations.

SWOT Analysis
  Strengths
  *	User Friendly
  *	Fast Calculation
  *	Can be used anywhere and every time	
   Weakness
  *	Does not perform all mathematical operations
  *	Continuous input is required for each operation
  Threats
  *	Program may end when wrong input is given.
  *	Fault results for invalid inputs	
  Opportunities
  *	Saves Human power.
  *	Attracts user with higher efficiency
    
4 W 1 H
  *	What – A calculator is a application which is used to perform mathematical calculations.
  *	When – A calculator is used when the calculations need to be performed are complex. 
  *	Why – A calculator saves human power and provides accurate results.
  *	Where – It is used where the calculations are complex. 
  *	How – The calculator application takes the input from the user and produces the output.
  
High Level Requirements
  *	Calculator must produce the correct result defined by the arithmetic rules.
  *	If the invalid inputs are given the calculator must display information to resolve the situation.
  
Low Level Requirements
  *	All functions are expected to accept only real numbers.
  *	Prevent user from divide by zero error.
